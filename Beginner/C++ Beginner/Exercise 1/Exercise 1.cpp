    Exercise 1:
    
    Create a header file and declare a function in the 'TMC' namespace which converts the 
    temperature in °F to °C. Then in the main function, which is 
    already defined, use this function to convert from 110.2 °F to °C. 

    Celcius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

    Print the result to the console by using the standard character out, std::cout. 
    When converting from 110.2 °F the result should be 43.444 °C.
