/*
    Exercise 3:

    Given the array defined in the main function, create a function that processes the array by counting
    the number of items that are above 50 and sets the values to 0 if they are below 50.

    Print the result to the console using:

        std::cout << "Numbers above 50: " << count << "\n";

    where count is the variable name which contains the count.
    To verify the number replacement worked correctly, print the first 5 elements to the console.

    Call the function in the main function.


    The result should be:

    Numbers above 50: 54
    50
    0
    0
    0
    87
